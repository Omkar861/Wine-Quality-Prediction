# This repository contains a project focused on predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project includes physicochemical properties of red and white wines, alongside their quality scores rated by experts.

# Features
1. Dataset: The Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consisting of chemical characteristics and quality labels.
2. Goal: Predict the quality of wine on a scale of 0 to 10 based on its features.

# Key Techniques:
1. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
2. Feature scaling and engineering.
3. Model training with machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
5. Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


#Project Structure
1. data/: Contains the dataset files.
2. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training.
3. src/: Scripts for data processing and modeling.
4. models/: Saved models and pipelines.
5. requirements.txt: Dependencies required to run the project.
6. README.md: Project overview and usage instructions.


# Results
Achieved an accuracy of XX% (replace with your result) on the test set using the best-performing model.
Feature importance analysis to identify key contributors to wine quality.
